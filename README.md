ng on, and when you're not just walk stands on, walk away, and return when you're inspired.
#### *3.Effort*
To have a growth mindset try always to go out from your comfort zone, by effort you will eventually make things ,that seems hard and uncomfortable for you to do at the beggining, easier and you will get used to do it.
#### *4.Criticism*
Always review your day and assess how you have done by asking your self two questions:

1- What was the best part of the day?

2-What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?
