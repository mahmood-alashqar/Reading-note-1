## *Maintaining a growth mindset*
#### *1.Challenges* 
Growth mindset stats that if you faced a challenge and you thought that you are incapable of solving it,instead of leave it and walk away to your comfort zone, just try again and again, look for new ways and methods until you figure out the root causes of the problem. And as what Albert Einstein Said:
> It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.

#### *2.Obstacles*
When you had obstacles in any project you working on, and when you're not just walk stands on, walk away, and return when you're inspired.
#### *3.Effort*
To have a growth mindset try always to go out from your comfort zone, by effort you will eventually make things ,that seems hard and uncomfortable for you to do at the beggining, easier and you will get used to do it.
#### *4.Criticism*
Always review your day and assess how you have done by asking your self two questions:

1- What was the best part of the day?

2-What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
