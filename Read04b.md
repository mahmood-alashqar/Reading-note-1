# HOW DO COMPUTERS WORK

Computers are everywhere! they are in people's pockets, in their cars,  they even have them on their wrists. **but what does make computer a computer?**

Computers started only as basic calculators in the beggining,The pioneers in this field realized that computer had to perform four different tasks:

1. **Input**: the input to the computer are the things you do that make the computer do stuff

2. **Storage**: these inputs give computer information which will be stored in a memory.

3. **Processing**: a processor takes these information and manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm, and then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again

4. **Output**: the output of computer depends on what the computer is designed for, like a computer can show text,photos,videos or interactive games

# ONES AND ZEROES
inside a computer electric wires and circuits carry all the information in a computer. In these wires you can store 0 or 1 using the binary number system

# CIRCUITS
every input or output of a computer is effectively a type of information which can be represented by on or off (or ones and zeroes) electrical signals. computer can do this by using millions of teeny electronic computers, which come together to form circuits.

**Type of circuits** 
there are several type of circuits, for example **AND** circuits take two electrical signals, if either of the signals coming in is a 0, then the result is also a 0, both of them should be a one then the result is a one.

# CPU, Memory, Input & Output
computer can take many different types of input, like the keyboard,mouse, the touchpad, microphone, camera, etc...

Output devices are too many, and they depends on what is required for example, a speaker will play sound and a 3D printer will print an object.

CPU is responsible for processing all these different types of input before make it as a output, so the cpu type and speed will control you processing time.

# Hardware and Software
All what is discussed above is about the hardware, software is all of the computer programs  or codes running on the computer, software can be anything from apps, games , and webpages. But, how software and hardware interact together.

CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer based on an order from a software. for example , an **add** command tells the cpu to use its outer circuits to calculate a new number.
