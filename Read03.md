# HTML & CSS structure
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages and the same applies to the website structure.
So HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning. like h1 tag used write the text in a large heading: 

```<h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>```

Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
# Extra Markup
HTML has several versions to keep up with the evolution of the technologies, because of that every web page should have something called DOCTYPE to indicate the HTML version that the web page used:

```<!DOCTYPE html>```

For adding comments in your code which will be not visible to the user you can use these characters:

```<!-- comment goes here -->```
